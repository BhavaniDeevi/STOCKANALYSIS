🌟 Proud to showcase my latest project: Stock Analysis & Performance Dashboard 🌟

I recently completed a comprehensive stock analysis and performance dashboard utilizing Tableau to provide in-depth insights into market trends and individual stock performance.

🔍 Key Features:

Dynamic visualizations of stock price movements, trading volumes, and key performance indicators
Interactive tools for detailed portfolio comparisons, sector analysis, and historical trend tracking
Customizable filters for sector, market capitalization, and time frame, enabling tailored insights for users
User-centric design, ensuring ease of navigation and data interpretation for informed decision-making
This project has enhanced my skills in data visualization, business intelligence, and dashboard development, and I am excited to leverage these capabilities in future opportunities.
